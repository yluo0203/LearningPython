10-1_ADVANCED TOPICS IN PYTHON

    lambda expressions
    Use filter() and a lambda expression to print out only the squares that are between 30 and 70 (inclusive).
    Iterating Over Dictionaries
    dictionary methods: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm
    Comprehending Comprehensions
    Use a list comprehension to create a list, threes_and_fives, that consists only of the numbers between 1 and 15 (inclusive) 
    List Slicing / Lambda Expressions
    The string in the editor is garbled in two ways: 1. Our message is backwards. 2. The letter we want is every other letter. Use list slicing to extract the message and save it to a variable called message

10-2_BITWISE OPERATORS

    Slip and Slide
    Define a function called flip_bit that takes the inputs (number, n).
    Flip the nth bit (with the ones bit being the first bit) and store it in result.
    Return the result of calling bin(result).
